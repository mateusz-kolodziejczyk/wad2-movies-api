# Assignment 2 - Web API.

Name: Your Name

## Features.

...... A bullet-point list of the ADDITIONAL features you have implemented in the API **THAT WERE NOT IN THE LABS** ......,
 
 + Feature 1 - .... a statement of its purpose/objective ..... 
 + Feature 2 - .......
 + Feature 3 = ......
 + etc
 + etc

## Installation Requirements

Describe what needs to be on the machine to run the API (Node v?, NPM, MongoDB instance, any other 3rd party software not in the package.json). 

Describe getting/installing the software, perhaps:

```bat
git clone http:\myrepo.git
```

followed by installation

```bat
git install
```

## API Configuration
Describe any configuration that needs to take place before running the API. For example, creating an ``.env`` and what variables to put in it. Give an example of how this might be structured/done.
REMEMBER: DON'T PUT YOUR OWN USERNAMES/PASSWORDS/AUTH KEYS IN THE README OR ON GITHUB, just placeholders as indicated below:

```bat
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=8080
HOST=
mongoDB=YourMongoURL
seedDb=true
secret=YourJWTSecret
```


## API Design
Give an overview of your web API design, perhaps similar to the following: 

|  |  GET | POST | PUT | DELETE
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- 
| /api/movies |Gets a list of movies | N/A | N/A |
| /api/movies/{movieid} | Get a Movie | N/A | N/A | N/A
| /api/movies/{movieid}/reviews | Get all reviews for movie | Create a new review for Movie | N/A | N/A  
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ...

If you have your API design on an online platform or graphic, please link to it (e.g. [Swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/)).


## Security and Authentication
Give details of authentication/ security implemented on the API(e.g. passport/sessions). Indicate which routes are protected.
Protected routes:
    /api/movies | All|
    /api/users/:username/favourites | Restricted to a logged in user |

## Integrating with React App

Describe how you integrated your React app with the API. Perhaps link to the React App repo and give an example of an API call from React App. For example: 

~~~Javascript
export const getMovies = () => {
  return fetch(
     '/api/movies',{headers: {
       'Authorization': window.localStorage.getItem('token')
    }
  }
  )
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(json => {return json.results;});
};
